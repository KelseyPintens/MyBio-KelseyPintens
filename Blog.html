            <p>...Chapter Gitting There -becoming a ux/ui designer/front end developer</p>

            <p>Week 1 - Gitting Started
                
            </p>

            <p>Hey there and welcome to a chapter of my life.  This is the very first week of the rest of my life.  Here's to trying everything for the first time.  Coming to a class, meeting all new people and starting an adventure towards a new career.  With Industrial Design background, the design aspect was very familiar to me, however the tech side was completely new.  What is a termial?  What is GitHub?I barely know what HTML or CSS is.  And don't even get me started on Javascript.  Start small though!  Number one take away from this week, termial isn't going to kill you. </p>

            <p>Week 2 - Gitting Git
                
                </p>

            <p>It's week 2, I now am Gitting GitHub.  and what, our first project already!  Even with a few snow day set backs, excited to dig in and just whip up a website, right?  Wrong, I can lay out the simplest layout on Adobe XD, yet no matter how hard I try, I can't drag the boxes around on the screen when I'm coding.  So much frustration realizing that coding isn't as flexible as I thought.  I loved creating the persona and problem something that I am very use to but need to push myself to do the things that I am uncomfortable with, the codinggggg.  I get github, but i don't, but I do.  Definatley experiencing the roller coaster ride I was warned about.</p>

                <p>Week 3 - Gitting xx
                
                    </p>

                <p>snow week, wtf nashville shut down</p>


                <p>week 4 Gitt</p>

            <p>It's week 3, Javascript time.  Just when I thought I was all caught up, NO.  Another group project.  The part of the project I focused on was the rebranding.  I enjoyed the project, in my comfort zone, I know, but I'll get there, give me time.   It taught me a lot of css and I am excited about both my knowledge in css and html, buttttt javascript can disappearn any day now.  and what is flexbox, I am all about the absolute positioning right now.  My struggles, billable hours.  Working in a way that is efficient to get quality results in tight time constraints. </p>

            <p>week 5 gitt</p>

            <p>I get flexbox.  amazing how when your forced to use something how easy it then comes</p>
